# Sleep Streak

2025 MAS Team Sleeper Agents project. 

Many people lack the motivation to have consistent, healthy sleep schedules and sleep habits. To build lasting sleep habits, SleepStreak not only tracks your sleep patterns but also fosters accountability through social support. Through friendly competition between friends and family, users will be encouraged to maintain good sleep. This solution offers simple sleep tracking through the user's mobile device with the option of fitness wearables data. Users can view a leaderboard to see where they rank among their friends and family. Also, rewards can be given to users who keep up their streak and reach certain milestones.
